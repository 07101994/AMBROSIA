Native-code Service Example
===========================

This directory contains an example service written using the
native-code client library (libambrosia), which provides an API for
low-level message-passing interactions with the AMBROSIA immortal
coordinators.

This example service does NOT use any high-level RPC library, rather,
libambrosia provides only bindings that encapsulate building and
sending correctly formatted messages for the AMBROSIA runtime.
